# Catch
FruitCatcher is my first project. A game made in HTML (Canvas), CSS3 and JavaScript where you have to catch radnom falling fruit in 1 minute. Every type of fruit have different number of points and if you catch it, you got 1 more second on the clock, but if you do not, you lose 3 seconds. Not fair ha? Try it.
